        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Meghan Tierney! I'm currently a Senior at UMass Amherst studying English with a minor in Sociology, and a specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. After graduating, I plan to pursue opportunities in technical writing, editorial work, and digital marketing.  </p>

        <h2>My Interests and Goals</h2>
        <p>My interest in the English major stems from my love of reading and writing, yet shifted as I delved deeper into the opportunities offered through the English program. I found that audience-focused writing and marketing became the ultimate driving force for my studies and subsequently added a concentration that supported these interests. During my undergraduate experience in professional writing and technical communication, I have worked on a variety of projects that combine my interests in digital design, technical writing, and user experience. Through this work, I have developed a strong foundation in software practices and design theory, which have greatly informed my professional experience in the publishing industry. </p>
        <p>Currently, I am employed as an editorial and marketing intern at Restless Books, a non-profit publishing group. There, I manage both working on acquisitions in-house while also presenting new titles to the public through creative marketing initiatives. The collaborative environment of a small press allows me to gain hands-on experience while simultaneously giving me the freedom to pursue my own passion projects in publishing. As I look ahead, I hope to continue my work in the publishing field and possibly shift my focus specifically to the editorial world and the magazine industry. My continued dedication to engaging diverse audiences with intent and clarity through multimedia creation will serve me well in these roles. </p>
