    <h1>Abroad Experience</h1>
    <p>I chose this photo as a potential representation of my study abroad experience that I plan to include on my final website. I intend to display my studies in London and the work I did there, so I figured what better to depict this than a photo of an iconic London image.</p>

<h1>Grant Proposal</h1>
<p>I want to include the grant proposal I wrote for English 379 about an environmental club and promoting sustainablity through art and activity. I could probably find an image that represents this better, but I thought this graphic was an interesting way to look at climate change and its impacts.</p>
